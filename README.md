## Contents
    This project folder contains a webpage that describes the difference between 
    relative and direct file paths and asks questions.

## GitHub
    So far I have learned how to commit files to different branches on a local machine
     and how to then push those files to various remote branches. I also know how to 
     merge branches, get the status of branches, and make new branches. I also learned 
     how to create and pull from online repositories.
